# 🎀 Custom Skin-Match Makeup Store
*A Spec-Driven Development (SDD) vs. Vibe Coding Experiment*

## 📖 Overview
This repository serves as a comparative study between unstructured AI-assisted coding ("Vibe Coding") and structured, architecture-first implementation ("Spec-Driven Development"). The core application is a lightweight Python CLI that recommends tailored makeup products based on a user's skin profile.

## 🌿 Branch Architecture
To demonstrate the workshop's core concepts, this repository is split into distinct workflows:

* **`vibe_coded_submission` Branch:** Features `makeup_store.py`, developed using raw, unstructured LLM prompting. It relies on heavy, nested `if/else` conditional logic.
* **`sdd_submission` Branch:** Features `makeup.py` and `project.md`, developed using strict Spec-Driven Development principles. The architecture was planned in Markdown first, resulting in a clean, scalable dictionary-mapping algorithm that completely avoids nested conditionals.
# 🚀 Reports API: CSV Export Feature
*An exploration of Spec-Driven Development (SDD) vs. Vibe Coding*

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains my submission for the **Future of Software Development with LLMs** workshop. The primary objective was to implement a secure, scalable CSV export feature (`GET /reports.csv`) for an existing FastAPI backend. 

More importantly, this project serves as a practical comparative study between two AI-assisted coding paradigms: unstructured "Vibe Coding" and structured "Spec-Driven Development" (SDD).

## 🌿 Branch Architecture & Methodology

To demonstrate the contrasting methodologies, this project is split into distinct branches:

### 1. The `vibe-work` Branch (Round 1)
* **Approach:** Unstructured prompting ("Vibe Coding"). The feature was requested via a raw natural language prompt with no underlying architectural constraints.
* **Result:** While the AI generated functional code quickly, it produced a naive implementation. It failed to respect data privacy boundaries (leaking `internal_id` and `owner_email`) and lacked safety constraints (no row-cap limits).

### 2. The `openspec-work` Branch (Round 3)
* **Approach:** Spec-Driven Development using the `openspec` CLI (v1.2.0). 
* **Process:** 1. Created a strict `proposal.md` defining the *Why*, *What*, and *Impact*.
  2. Defined explicit requirements in `specs/reports/spec.md` (e.g., RFC 4180 compliance).
  3. Validated and archived the specs before finalizing the implementation.
* **Result:** A bulletproof, production-ready implementation. The SDD approach forced the AI to respect a strict column allowlist, successfully mitigating data leaks, and inherently handled edge cases like the 100,000-row `HTTP 413` cap.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
* **Tooling:** OpenSpec CLI (`@fission-ai/openspec`)
* **Workflow:** Git, Virtual Environments (`venv`)

## 🎓 Acknowledgments
A massive thank you to **Prof. Saikiran Puvvada** for designing such a brilliant and eye-opening workshop. The transition from chaotic "prompt-and-pray" generation to structured, spec-driven architecture has completely changed how I approach AI-assisted software engineering. The "trap" of Round 1 was an incredible teaching moment!

# Reports API

A small FastAPI service that exposes a paginated `/reports` endpoint backed by a deterministic in-memory dataset.

## Layout

```
app/
├── __init__.py
├── data.py        # Seed dataset (120 rows, deterministic)
├── models.py      # Pydantic models — internal vs public
├── reports.py     # Filter / sort / pagination query layer
└── main.py        # FastAPI HTTP layer
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- pip

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IITMBSMLOps/SpecDrivenDevelopmentBase.git
cd SpecDrivenDevelopmentBase

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -e .
```

## Run the API

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Then hit it from another terminal:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/health"
curl "http://localhost:8000/reports?limit=3" | python -m json.tool
```

## Endpoints

| Method | Path       | Description                                            |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| GET    | `/health`  | Liveness probe — returns `{"status": "ok"}`.           |
| GET    | `/reports` | Paginated list of reports with filtering and sorting.  |

### `GET /reports` query parameters

| Param        | Type            | Default      | Notes                                            |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `status`     | enum            | —            | One of `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `archived`. |
| `date_from`  | datetime (ISO)  | —            | Lower bound on `created_at` (inclusive).         |
| `date_to`    | datetime (ISO)  | —            | Upper bound on `created_at` (inclusive).         |
| `sort`       | string          | `created_at` | One of `id`, `title`, `status`, `owner`, `amount`, `created_at`. |
| `descending` | bool            | `true`       | Sort direction.                                  |
| `offset`     | int (>=0)       | `0`          | Pagination offset.                               |
| `limit`      | int (1..200)    | `20`         | Page size.                                       |

## ⚙️ How to Run
